# Matt Szabo's portfolio
This is my portfolio, which is written using **react** components. It's hosted on an Amazon EC2 server using node.js: http://ec2-54-206-69-241.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3300/

The webpage is a single page app written with a mobile first approach. It is also my first attempt at a full webpage, so there have been many learning milestones at different stages of development.

## install
```git clone https://github.com/wekilledit/portfolio-frontend.git portfolio-frontend```  
```cd portfolio-frontend```  
```npm install```  

## build
Run a webpack build to the build/release directory:
`$ npm run build`

## dev
Start a webpack dev server at http://localhost:8080/ with webpack's hot module replacement running for an auto refresh on code change:
`$ npm start`
