        Description: This was the first piece of web development I was exposed to. It began with a friend suggesting I use yeoman to generate some angular boilerplate. After doing that I jumped into a tutorial to create a todo list, which I continued experimenting with afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project exposed me to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yeoman</li>
        <li>Bower</li>
        <li>Grunt</li>
        <li>npm</li>
        <li>Node.js and express</li>
        <li>JavaScript, HTML, CSS</li>
        <li>Angular</li>
        <li>Single page app design</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default AngularProject;
