        Description: This project focused on learning Redux. I began with creating a basic single counter app and then wanted to expand it but didn't know how. So I followed the tutorial at https://learnredux.com/, which showed me how to make a mock instagram app ***LINK***. I then used this knowledge to complete my original goal of having multiple counters with different configurations and also the ability to add and remove counters.

        This project exposed me to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Redux</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ReduxProject;
