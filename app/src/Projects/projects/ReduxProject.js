        Description: This project focused on learning Redux. I began with following the tutorial at https://learnredux.com/, which showed me how to make an instagram type app ***LINK***. Using that as a basis I created a simple counter app.

      <p>
        This project exposed me to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Redux</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ReduxProject;
